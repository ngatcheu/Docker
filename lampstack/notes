Let’s build that image
$ docker build -t kserge2001/web-serge .

Now, run the container with that image
$docker run -d -p 88:80 kserge/web-serge

You can access it from your browser 192.168.1.96:88 with 
$ifconfig

Let’s push that image on the docker hub:
docker push kserge2001/web-serge

1-Install Apache
Use the following command to install Apache: # yum install httpd

Now enable the httpd daemon with:
# chkconfig httpd on (For CentOS 6)
# systemctl enable httpd
(For CentOS 7)

At this stage, if you are on CentOS 7 then you need to open the port for
httpd
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp

Start the httpd daemon with:
# service httpd start
# systemctl start httpd (for CentOS 7)

to access this on a browser, we need to check the IP address of our
Host machine. To do that:
a. Open a new terminal (a new tab if you are in MobaXterm)
b. Run the ifconfig command and take the IP address in enp0s3
c. Now paste the address of your host in the browser, followed by
the port number. Mine is 192.168.1.141:81

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2-Install MySQL
The database software

The command we use is:
# yum install mysql-server -y
# yum install mariadb -y (For CentOS 7)

Start the mysql service with:
# service mysqld start
# systemctl start mariadb (for CentOS 7)


Now enable it with:
 # chkconfig mysqld on
 # systemctl enable mariadb
(For CentOS 7)

Let’s set the root password for mysql
# mysql_secure_installation 
(same for
CentOS 7)
 
Now, login to mysql to create a database to
store informations for our website
# mysql -u root -p (same for CentOS 7)

Let’s display all the databases in there:
mysql> show databases;

Still in the mysql prompt, let’s create our database:
mysql> create database webserver;                (webserver here is the db name)
mysql> show databases;

Let’s create a user that an access the database with its password
mysql> create user oracle@localhost identified by ‘school1’;

Give the user oracle access to the database webserver
mysql> grant all privileges on webserver.* to oracle@localhost identified
by ‘school1’;

Let’s load the privileges: mysql> flush privileges;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4-Install Php
The Web development Software

To install Php, we use:
# yum install php php-mysql -y
(same on CentOS 7)

We need to test if php is
successfully installed and running

fine. To do that:
Create a file called info.php in the
directory /var/www/html
# cd /var/www/html
# vim info.php

Let’s restart Apache:
# service httpd restart
# systemctl httpd restart (for CentOS 7)

Let’s access it in the browser:
∙ In the browser, enter the IP address of your host to verify the
Apache page.

Then add info.php at the end (/IPaddress:portnumber/info.php) to
check the php page
∙ Ex: 192.168.1.28:81/info.php
∙ If you see the following page, then all is working successfully!


Let’s install some
additional packages for
Php: php-gd
# yum install php-gd
(yes to confirm)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5.
Install Wordpress
The CMS : Content Management System

To install Wordpress, we need to download the compressed file and
extract it
# cd /tmp
# wget http://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.1.1.tar.gz
Note: If wget command is not found, install it: yum install wget
⬡ Now, let’s extract the file
# tar -xzvf wordpress-5.1.1.tar.gz
# ls

You can remove the tar.gz file now: rm -rf wordpress-5.1.1.tar.gz
⬡ Copy wordpress content to /var/www/html folder
# cp -r wordpress/* /var/www/html/
⬡ Make sure the command worked fine
# cd /var/www/html/
# ll


Now create a directory called wp-content/uploads in /var/www/html
# mkdir /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads

Now, copy the content of wp-config-sample.php to the file
wp-config.php
# cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
# ls


For ls to display the last item created at the end of the list, yo can use
ls -ltr
⬡ Let’s modify that file to set up the mysql connection with the
webserver database and the user oracle
# vim wp-config.php

Now, we need to change the ownership on /var/www/html
# chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/*

-R means recursive (set the same ownership on all the subdirectories
and files under a folder)
⬡ Restart the httpd service # service httpd restart
⬡ Open the browser and let’s install Wordpress
⬡ To do that, enter your IP address:portNumber in the browser
